Machine learning code for predicting behavioral function
Download the file file along with the CSV file(s). 
The csv file should be saved in the same directory as the python file. 
In order to run you need python 3.0+ and the following python libraries: sci-kit learn, keras, numpy, pandas
These can be more easily obtained by downloading and installing Anaconda or Mini-conda: https://www.anaconda.com
Run the file by opening your terminal (Mac) or or command prompt (Windows) and running the script by name.

For the Naive Bayes classifier the dataset is divided into four separate CSV files (Fulltest1.csv, Fulltests2.csv, Fulltest3.csv, Fulltest4.csv). All four files must be in the directory to run. 

For all other classifiers use 'Fulltest.csv'

These classifiers are NOT meant to be used in clinical practice.
